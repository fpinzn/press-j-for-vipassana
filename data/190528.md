I feel like I'm still discovering the best way to communicate mental motility using this tool.

And it seems to going to be this way for a long time.

I think keeping one key pressed while on a trin of though can be useful to differentiate it from a sudden and short thought that simply passes.

Also,pressing j only after three mindful exhalations might make that signal more meaningful,because is pretty common to try to return to a centered state using the breathing just to be carried away immediately in the next.

The sure must be some kind of tradition that uses drawing in some way to make this exercise.
