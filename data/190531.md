Decided to separate the commentary from the input to process de data easier.

I feel that the overhead of thinking about the system is paid off by the focus that comes with being extra conscious of your finger.

I think that distraction comes (at least) in pairs of thoughts. The one that appears by itself, independently on the screen of the mind, and the one that follows that puts into motion the train of thought.

Having the mind in a total blank state is quite difficult, and I only have experienced it in a handful of times for a very short time. 

For this reason I think one should treat the initial thought (for lack of a better name) as one treats the senses. Is a stream of information. And that one thought appears in my mind doesnt mean that I have lost focus, the thought simply emerges. The control exercise is in not allowing the mind to slip into going with it.
