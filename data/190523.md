Great session, I felt like I was getting in a deep concentration state towards the end.

During the exercise I devised an interesting way to play:

- When I discover I'm in a trin thought I try to count the mental steps that I followed since first losing focus on the present. For example:

    - I felt the leg numb
    - I rembebered going to crossfit yesterday
    - I thought of buying better shoes for training

That would be tree jumps.

When I see I've jumped three times forward I use the exhalation to go backwards in the train of thought, while pressing f. When I get to the first one I use another exhalation to let it go and get back to the present moment and press j immediately after.

This establishes a sense of directonality that can be interesting to think about.
