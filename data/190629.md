The amount of keys in use make the exercise incompatible with having a clear mind, because immediately one presses a key and expects to return to a clear mind state the thought of having pressed the correct key (was i hijacked completely by thought or was I simply some steps away from a clear mind?)

I think it's necessary to redefine the exercise.
