I did a guided meditation before using this 'tool'.

I feel I've found a  of the experiment: to focus on the sequentiality of thoughts, and keep the idea of goign forth or backwards or to focus on the lost of conscousness that one is thinking.

The sequentallity needes/implies the development of another ability: to be able to recognize each thought of the sequence without multiplying them.
